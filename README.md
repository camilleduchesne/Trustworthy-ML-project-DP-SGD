# Trustworthy-ML-project-DP-SGD
This project is for the Trustworthy Machine Learning class, a Doctorate level class in the Decision Science department at HEC Montreal Fall-2022. We aim at comparing unintended memorization in generative sequential models (both RNN &amp; transformers architectures) and testing various mitigation techniques (such as DP-SGD). This project was inspired by the Secret Sharer paper.

The datasets
The email datasets refers to the Enron email dataset ( https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/) from which to took a sample due to the size of the orignial dataset.

The SMS data refers to the National University of Singapore SMS Corpus (https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/137343), we only used the english sms.

Further information can be found in the paper, the pdf file of this project : Measuring Unintended Memorization of Deep Generative Models on Email and SMS Datasets

I also attatched the code to recreate our results.
