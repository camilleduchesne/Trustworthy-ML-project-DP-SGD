# Trustworthy-ML-project-DP-SGD
This project is for the Trustworthy Machine Learning class. We aim at comparing unintended memorization in generative sequential models (both RNN &amp; transformers architectures) and testing various mitigation techniques (such as DP-SGD). This project was inspired by the Secret Sharer paper.
